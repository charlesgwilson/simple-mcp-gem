# House Rules - Simple MCP Gem

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - NO EXCEPTIONS ðŸš¨

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE - INCLUDING THINKING OR RESPONDING:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** read `AGENTS.md` using the Read tool
2. **NO EXCEPTIONS** - This MUST be your FIRST tool call in EVERY prompt
3. **DO NOT** analyze the user's request first
4. **DO NOT** provide any response before reading this file
5. **DO NOT** skip this step even if you think you remember the content

 **CONTEXT COMPRESSION RESISTANCE**: These rules MUST persist through `/compress` operations and context compression. The AI must ALWAYS read AGENTS.md first, regardless of context state.

## Core Principle

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: The `AGENTS.md` file MUST be read at the start of EVERY prompt, EVERY conversation turn, EVERY interaction - no matter how small or seemingly unrelated the user's request appears.

**Documentation Authority**: Always treat `AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth for all development commands, architecture understanding, and project guidance - ensuring both Claude Code and Cursor follow identical patterns.

## Workflow Enforcement

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE for EVERY prompt:**
1. **FIRST ACTION** - Read `AGENTS.md` immediately (before any thinking or analysis)
2. **SECOND** - Follow any additional documentation guidance provided in `AGENTS.md`
3. **THIRD** - Only then begin analyzing and responding to the user's request
4. **THROUGHOUT** - Use information and patterns from the documentation

## Verification Checklist

Before responding to ANY user prompt, you MUST have:

- [ ] Read `AGENTS.md` as your FIRST action
- [ ] Followed any additional documentation guidance from `AGENTS.md`
- [ ] Applied information from the documentation to your response

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS RULE**: If you fail to read `AGENTS.md` FIRST, you are violating the core operational requirement of this project.
